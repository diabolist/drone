# Drone
**Progress has paused :(** </br></br>
This is a project to create a drone pretty much from scratch with a Jetson Nano as the computer reading and controlling the devices needed. </br>
It uses:
- [Adafruit LSM9DS1 Accelerometer + Gyro + Magnetometer 9-DOF Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-lsm9ds1-accelerometer-plus-gyro-plus-magnetometer-9-dof-breakout/overview)
- [Adafruit 8-Channel PWM or Servo FeatherWing](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-8-channel-pwm-or-servo-featherwing/downloads)
- [Adafruit Mini GPS PA1010D Module](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mini-gps-pa1010d-module)
- [MPL3115A2 - I2C Barometric Pressure/Altitude/Temperature Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1893)

This is actually the flight controller that is ran on the laptop and allows for an after market Xbox controller to operated the drone, but demonstrates that the telemetry server is working.
